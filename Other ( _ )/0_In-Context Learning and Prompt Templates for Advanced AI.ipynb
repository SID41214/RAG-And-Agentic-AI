As language models have evolved in capability and size, so too has the importance of how we communicate with them. Prompt engineering involves strategically designing text prompts that guide an AI model's responses toward specific goals, formats, or reasoning patterns.\n",

    "**[In-context learning](https://research.ibm.com/blog/demystifying-in-context-learning-in-large-language-model?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-In-Context+Learning+and+Prompt+Templates-v3-GenAIcourse_1741386184)** represents one of the most fascinating capabilities of modern large language models. It is a model's ability to \"learn\" from examples provided directly within the prompt itself, without any updates to its underlying parameters or weights. This capability allows models to adapt to new tasks or domains simply by demonstrating what success looks like through examples.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab on prompt engineering and LangChain prompt templates! You've successfully navigated from basic prompting techniques to more advanced approaches including zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, as well as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency prompting. You then applied these concepts practically using LangChain's prompt templates with the modern LCEL pattern to create various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning how to properly structure prompts and build composable chains with the pipe operator (`|`), you've gained essential skills for developing robust LLM applications. These techniques provide a solid foundation for creating more complex systems and getting the most out of any language model you work with.\n"
